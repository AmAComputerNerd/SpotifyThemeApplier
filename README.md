# SpotifyThemeApplier
Through the use of some Python magic, simply open the file, enter the name of one of the listed themes, and it'll be automatically applied and refreshed!

Note - this project uses Spicetify to customize Spotify. As such, you will need to have Spicetify installed prior to running the script, or you will be met with a notice that it is not installed. It can be installed here: https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes
